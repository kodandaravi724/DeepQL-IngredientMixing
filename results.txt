In the training phase, I ran the model with 30 episodes and 90 steps in each episode.

I build the neural network with two hidden layers and used linear as activation function for output layer and relu for hidden layers.

In testing phase, out of 100 trails it mixed successfully 71 times.

It took 37 sec to mix successfully and to run for 100 episodes it took total of 470 sec to run for 100 trails.
